# Community Project
1. https://droitthemes.com/wp/mak/home-dark/ check out this theme example.  We will be building a clone of this site.  We are starting on the landing page.  After talking to Grace I decided that we should aim to make an exact copy.  Don't worry about javascript at this point.
Create a simple HTML and CSS REPO on GitHub and share in the projects page.
3.  Start working on the header and many section.  Also for now just work on desktop view and not mobile.
4. If finish the menu can start on the hero section with the call to action and resume buttons.
5. Push your changes to netlify or GitHub pages so you can share your page and your repo in the projects thread.
6. Don't be shy to help each other out.  I am sure that I have just as much to learn from you as we do from everyone else.
